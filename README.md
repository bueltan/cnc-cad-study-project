Prototype Design Software, CNC Software Controller, and Router for Polyethylene Cutting.

The decision to develop this project was driven by a desire to learn. Initiated in early 2013, it was completed in mid-2014 due to various reasons. The primary motivation behind the development of this project was to gain knowledge and experience in computer-programmed machining processes, independent of software and hardware already developed by third parties. In contrast to complex industrial CNC machines and software, this project provides a more basic perspective.

The objective of this project is to provide a foundational tool for students and individuals seeking to understand or venture into CNC machine processes. The material, documentation, and experience gained from this project are intended to support and serve new ideas, whether for different purposes or not. Furthermore, individuals can use this prototype project as a basis to develop more elaborate and complex CNC systems.

It is worth noting that this system was developed using the GAMBAS programming language, which is a free programming language derived from BASIC. The system operates on the GNU/LINUX platform and recently on Mac systems. The complete system can be divided into three fundamental parts for better understanding:

    SOFTWARE: This includes graphics software and CNC software.
    ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS: This includes the connection interface, monitor circuit, protection circuit, and H. sensor circuits.
    MECHANICAL SYSTEM: This includes the X, Y, and Z axes, as well as the PAP bipolar motor.
